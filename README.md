Introduction
---

Welcome to the GitHub repository and project site for the MAXIS BlueZone Scripts! This project aims to automate repetetive, error prone tasks using simple extensions to the BlueZone Mainframe Display system. These scripts do not contain any confidential data, nor do they contain information about how to log in to our various state systems. 

If you have questions about BlueZone Scripts and work in a Minnesota human services agency, please ask a supervisor about getting started.

##### GitHub workflow and organization

GitHub can be somewhat complex and daunting for beginners. For our organization, scripts are divided into two "branches":

* **MASTER**: the working directory for scriptwriters and select power users in scriptwriting agencies.
* **RELEASE**: the branch for most eligibility workers statewide.

Changes proposed here (assuming they "pass muster" with any policy/procedural folks involved at DHS) will first be merged into "master", then into "release" after at least a week of testing. Scriptwriters (and a few select "power users" in each agency) are expected to work off of the master branch, and contribute feedback throughout the month.

##### Issue list

We have an [issue list](https://github.com/MN-Script-Team/DHS-MAXIS-Scripts/issues) currently kept on GitHub. Feel free to tackle issues on that list, just please, comment the issue in GitHub before starting (so that way I, or someone else, doesn't start working on it first).

This is a casual (and, dare I say, fun) group, but we're doing a pretty epic project, with the goal of saving thousands of hours in work for all of Minnesota. So please be ready with a working knowledge of VBScript, an understanding of Minnesota's assistance programs, and a sense of humor, and I'm sure this will go well.

If you don't have a great working knowledge of VBScript, you can find out more by checking out the Wiki on this repository!

Oh, and don't be surprised if I'm pushing commits late in the evening. Frankly, I'm pretty obsessed with this project. ;)

Welcome to it!
